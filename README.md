# WikiArtGAN
 Generating Art using GANs and the WikiArt dataset.

## What is this?

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a framework for teaching a DL model to capture the training dataâ€™s distribution in order to generate new data from that same distribution. They are made of two distinct models, a generator and a discriminator. My goal in this project was to form a direct extension of a GAN that explicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the discriminator and generator, respectively. By training this model on the [WikiArt dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ipythonx/wikiart-gangogh-creating-art-gan), I was able to produce resulting generated images that genuinely embody elements of real artwork.

## How to run

Open and run cells in WikiArtGAN.ipynb or go to [the live Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19iVvmeFtKGFHc-ROuBMzhaYKMamGtdrF?usp=sharing) I'm experimenting with.
